# Simple language to generate fully connected networks

Define a fully-connected layer like this:
```
a=[n_nodes]
```
where n_nodes is a positive integer. In the example above, a is the layer name.
Successive layers can be added by just calling the function above multiple times.
![network made with this software](test.pdf) by using the following commands:
```
input=[28]
hidden1=[10]
